# Membership
_**Membership is your entr√©e to true community service via your interest in Amateur Radio.**_

Membership is open to all FCC licensed amateur radio operators who successfully pass the [basic training requirements](participation). To maintain membership, you are expected to check-in to weekly nets, attend monthly meetings and participate in community events and drills. These activities help us sharpen our communications skills. We are organized to provide communications support to various agencies of government and charitable organizations on request. It is through drills and other training that we become proficient in providing vital communications support in the event of a community need. Failure to maintain participation in DeKalb ARES activities will cause you to be dropped from our roster.

**The DeKalb ARES member who accumulates the highest number of service hours, as reported in the [Georgia ARES database](https://www.gaares.org/cgi-bin/login.pl), will receive an annual award for their participation.**  _Your Login Name is your callsign. If you have not used this database, check with either Steve Garrison([n4tty at arrl.net](mailto:n4tty@arrl.net)) or George Olive [(ai4ur at arrl.net)](mailto:ai4ur@arrl.net) for password assistance._
