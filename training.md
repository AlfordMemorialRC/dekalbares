# Training

The following links will take you to some of the sites used in training our members.

We utilize courses from both the ARRL and FEMA. We also use a general skills course created by the Gwinnett ARES group. We require that all members take and pass **either** this basic skills course or course EC-001 offered by the ARRL.

* Basic Skills: _(Either Gwinnett ARES or ARRL)_

For members interested in field deployment, we suggest you become proficient in basic first aid and CPR through courses offered by your local chapter of the American Red Cross. You may register as a Red Cross volunteer at this link. www.atlantaredcross.org

Being a Net Control operator is a great way to learn about net operations and get the practice you may need in a real emergency. Each active member of DeKalb ARES is expected to server as both Net Control and Alternate Net Control at least once per year. Please contact our AEC for Net Ops, Tom Fuller (KE4QCM) to schedule a turn at running our net.
