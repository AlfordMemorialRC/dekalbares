## What is DeKalb ARES
### Volunteers
The Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) consists of licensed radio amateurs who have voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment for communications duty in the public service when disaster strikes. Every licensed amateur, regardless of membership in ARRL or any other local or national organization, is eligible for membership in the ARES. The only qualification, other than possession of a valid amateur radio license, is a sincere desire to serve. Because ARES is an amateur radio service, only FCC licensed amateur radio operators are eligible for membership.

### In Preparation
DeKalb ARES is affiliated with the [American Radio Relay League (ARRL)](https://www.arrl.org) and operates primarily within the jurisdiction of [DeKalb County, GA](https://www.dekalbcountyga.gov/) We utilize the radio repeater facilities of the [Alford Memorial Radio Club](https://www.totr-radio.com) for our weekly training net.  Please see the [Net Operations](net) page for schedule and details.

[Our members train in emergency preparedness techniques via the nationally recognized ARRL and FEMA courses](training). Many of our members are considered **_deployable_** to serve away from our home base in times of need.
### With a Desire to Serve
DeKalb ARES members come from all segments of the community; from students to professionals to retirees. We welcome all members to participate *to the extent they can* to support our served agencies.

## Our Mission
