## How to install Winlink
You can find instructions related to the 2 Sep 2017 ARES meeting about how to install and use Winlink Express [here](files/Install_Winlink.pdf).

## DeKalb ARES Winlink check-in email template
Please use the Dekalb ARES Winlink check-in template when checking using RMS Express. This will make sure that all the information we need to report is collected an also makes it much easier to check in.

Instructions for installing the template into RMS Express may be found [here](files/RMS_Express_DCARES_Template.pdf). The template itself may be downloaded [here](files/DeKalb_ARES_Check-in.txt).

## D-Rats Chat Every Week
We will be running a d-rats chat alongside the regular net every week.

All you need is a computer running d-rats to participate. You can download d-rats for any operating system from [this site](https://www.d-rats.com/).

Follow the [setup instructions](https://www.d-rats.com/documentation/4-howtos/26-connect-to-the-ratflector/) using the following values for the radio information:

> **Name:** DeKalb ARES   
> **Type:** Network   
> **Host Address:** dares.dyndns.org   
> **Port:** 9000

Save the radio information. In the list of radios, the only box checked should be the "DeKalb ARES" you just entered.

## Now Connected To The Internet For Worldwide Message Access! (1/7/2011)
DeKalb ARES currently has an RMS Packet station located at the DeKalb Fire Rescue Headquarters building in Tucker, GA. This station operates on 145.59 MHz with the callsign KJ4QFY-10 which is the club callsign for DeKalb ARES.

Every DeKalb ARES member is encouraged to get the RMS Express client software installed and configured so when you have the hardware capability you will be ready with the software to use this station. RMS Packet and RMS Express are components of the WinLink 2000 Amateur Radio email system.

We take check-ins via WinLink during our Sunday evening DeKalb ARES Emergency Practice Net. Using RMS Express just address your "check-in" email to "KJ4QFY at WINLINK dot ORG."

Contact Greg Mann, AEC Digital Ops at wc4y.greg at gmail dot com for any assistance you may require in configuring the software or hardware on your system.
