# EMERGENCY ALERTING
We now have a system that will send a e-mail or text message to your cell or PC when we are activated. It also sends warnings from the National Weather Service that affect DeKalb County. 

If you want to be on this system, Submit **either** your e-mail address **or** your cell phone number and the name of your cellular provider to [EC](mailto:ec@dekalbares.org). That way, we can make sure the system can route the alert to the proper place.

We promise not to abuse this with meeting announcements and other non-critical info. We will, however, send a monthly test message to ensure that your alerting link is still intact.
