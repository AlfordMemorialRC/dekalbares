### Weekly ARES Practice Net
Every Sunday night at 8pm local time, the DeKalb ARES Practice Net meets on the 145.45 repeater of the Alford Memorial Radio Club.

The repeater operates on the frequency of *145.450 MHz with a minus(-) offset and PL tone of 107.2Hz*.

This net is open to anyone interested in amateur radio emergency communication and you don't need to be a member of DeKalb County ARES to participate.

Every week we have a different operator running the net. You can find a schedule showing who is scheduled to operate the net in the [Net Operations](net) page of this website.
