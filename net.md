# Net Operations
## Frequencies
DeKalb ARES operates a weekly training net on our primary frequency of:

> 145.45 MHz (-) PL 107.2

at 8:00 p.m. local time on Sunday.

## Alternate and Simplex Frequencies

> Alternate repeater = 146.76 MHz (-) 107.2 PL    
> Simplex operations = 146.46 MHz

## HF
We also encourage General Class licensees and above to check-in to the GA ARES net each *Sunday at 22:00 GMT on 3.975 MHz LSB*.

## Repeater Operation
The first Sunday of each month is designated as *Emergency Power Day* when we like to have our members check-in using their **emergency power supply** to verify its performance. This test of our emergency power capability demonstrates our readiness to support our served agencies in a time of commercial power loss.

Also on the first Sunday, we check in to the Metro Atlanta ARES Net on the 146.805 (+) (PL 100.0) repeater located in Jasper, GA. Hams from all over the Metro Atlanta area are invited to check in when their county is called.
