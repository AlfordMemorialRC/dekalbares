## START
> **Is the frequency in use?**   

`<if not proceed.....>`   

> **This is** `<YOUR CALL SIGN>` **Calling the DeKalb Emergency Practice Net. The DeKalb Emergency Practice Net is now in routine formal session. This net meets on Sunday nights at 8 P.M. local time and welcomes check­ins from all stations interested in public service communications. This net is affiliated with the Amateur Radio Emergency Service of the American Radio Relay League.** 

## NET CONTROL ID
> **The net control operator tonight is** `<GIVE CALL SIGN AND THEN REPEAT IN ITU PHONETICS>`**, my name is** `<GIVE YOUR NAME>` **and my location is** `<GIVE YOUR LOCATION>`**, I am running on** `<EMERGENCY or COMMERCIAL>` **power. This is a directed net. Please do not transmit unless called by Net Control. During the net, please direct all communications through Net Control,** `<YOUR CALL SIGN>`**. If you need to leave the net for any reason before it closes, please inform net control.** 

## EMERGENCY TRAFFIC
> **Stations having emergency traffic may "break in" at any time and we will handle your traffic immediately.  Do we have any emergency traffic?**

`<Pause 10 seconds. If there is no emergency traffic, say` **“Nothing Heard”** `and proceed, if there is any emergency
traffic, acknowledge the station calling and turn the net over to them.>`

## ALTERNATE NET CONTROL
> **Do I have anyone who would like to act as Alternate Net Control for tonight's net? An alternate net control will be able to continue the net in case my station goes out of service.**    

`<If an alternate net station calls in, acknowledge them and ask them to record the check-ins they hear, at the end of the net call them again and check to confirm if you received all stations checking-in- if no alternate net control is available, proceed to run the net as normal.>`

## WINLINK NET CONTROL
> **You may also check into this net using Winlink by sending your message to **KJ4QFY@WINLINK.ORG**. We encourage all members of DeKalb ARES to check in by Winlink in addition to this phone net. Do we have anyone who can monitor Winlink check­ins?**    

If a station is able to take Winlink check-ins, acknowledge them, and get the Winlink check-ins during the traffic and announcements portion of the net. If there is no Winlink net control, proceed to run the net as normal.

## TAKE CHECK-INS
Call signs are accepted in four groups based on first letter of the call sign prefix - thje groups are A-Alpha, K-Kilo, N-November and W-Whiskey. The check-ins will happen in clusters where a group of people will call in, then there will come a pause. At the pause, take control of the net an acknowledge the check-ins you just received. In order to keep the Net moving, call for each group only about 2 times. You have some discretion here, but don't keep calling the same group over and over.   

> **This is `<YOUR CALL SIGN>`, net control for tonight's DeKalb Emergency Practice Net.  We will take check­ins in four groups. We encourage check­ins from emergency power especially on the first Sunday of every month.  When I call for check­ins, please say “This is” and then unkey and listen; if you do not hear another station continue your transmission providing:   
• your name;
• your location;
• your call sign in ITU phonetics as I did earlier;
• whether you are on emergency/(Battery) or commercial power, and
• whether you have any announcements, questions or comments for the net.   
> Please speak slowly and clearly so I can accurately log you in.**
